                    <h2>Finding simplicity in life</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Life can get complicated really quickly</strong>, but it doesn't have to be! There are
                        many ways to simplify your life, <a href="#">a few of which we've explored in the past</a>. This
                        week we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you
                        already living.
                    </p>

                        <p>Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have to eat
                            healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.</p>

                        <p>Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship
                            with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it
                            will help balance everything out.</p>

                        <p>A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or they go
                            overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw
                            the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.</p>
