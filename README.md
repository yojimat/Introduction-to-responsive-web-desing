Browser default font-size is 16px;  
Percentage and em are inherited from the parent of the element, unless the element has a font size defined.  
Normally use 'rem' for font sizes and 'em' for paddings and margins.  
Try to name the classes in a form that you can add up and remove it without affecting the main class and can reason about it, for example: ```
col col-small col-1```.  
Use flex-start to pull the background of the divs up to the content.  
Try to put the html elements of the website in the correct semantic order for better accessibility, and change the order, in case of need, for better visual experience.  
Its a good habit to use hover with focus for better acessibility, since mobile phones does not have the hover event.
