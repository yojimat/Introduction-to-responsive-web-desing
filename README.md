Browser default font-size is 16px;  
Percentage and em are inherited from the parent of the element, unless the element has a font size defined.  
Normally use 'rem' for font sizes and 'em' for paddings and margins.  
Try to name the classes in a form that you can add up and remove it without affecting the main class and can reason about it, for example: ```
col col-small col-1```.  
Use flex-start to pull the background of the divs up to the content.
